# Protection-of-sensitive-data-with-zero-trust-model-and-machine-learning

The report advocates for the adoption of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) as a robust security framework necessary to combat evolving digital threats. Traditional perimeter security systems, which assume implicit trust after initial authentication, are insufficient against sophisticated attacks, including Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). ZTA, encapsulated by the principle "Never Trust, Always Verify," mandates continuous verification of every access request. Moreover, integrating Machine Learning (ML) is essential for real-time anomaly detection and automated threat mitigation, thus transforming the security response from reactive to proactive. Key challenges include the need for high-quality training data and the computational demands of complex AI models. ZTA enhances data protection across organizational roles, turning security from an IT function into an enterprise strategy essential for protecting sensitive data and maintaining compliance. It also facilitates security in dynamic environments like containerization, ensuring rigorous authentication and authorization for every access request.
